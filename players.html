          bk0944 - This player is one of the more precise players. With countless hours invested into getting the most precise aim and the fastest reaction time, they have displayed an outrageous amount of determination and competition while playing. Whilst bk0944 may not be the highest ranked player on the list, he has many scores that people both higher and lower ranks have trouble beating. Also, he has shown a linear progression trending upwards for a long time with very few roadblocks. What comes from this player is anticipated from many.      </p>

          C0C0Y - Despite being relatively new to the game, C0C0Y has put in a ludicrous amount of time in order to pass the others on this list. Having a lot of experience from other games, his determination to improve and be the best is uncontested. His fundamental skills in the game are similar to that of other games - aim and speed. With a mind as sharp as his own, he is able to apply skills to osu! as well, thus allowing him to rank up tremendously fast. C0C0Y has no signs of slowing down and has potential to become the best with continued hard work and time.

          GhostRadarZ - A versatile player. GhostRadarZ has experienced two sides of the game and has prolonged play with both a tablet and a mouse, whether or not it has helped him or hurt him in the long run is unknown. He currently has settled with a tablet and has shown substantial improvement since. He has invested a lot of time with the idea that he must acheive ranks, no matter the cost. This mentality has proved somewhat effective as it got him to where he is today, but with time it may not pan out as abundantly as it is currently. He has since noticed this and has worked towards being both adaptive and versatile.

          havokXO - Not too much is known about havokXO. What is known is that he is somewhat of a "jack of all trades". The scores that he has set in his time playing the game have ranged in styles and speeds, showing that he can play the game in many different ways. Furthermore, he has a less common style of play in the game as he plays on a much smaller resolution than others when in the game. It is hard to say what truly makes up havokXO, but it can be said that he is both unique and well-rounded.

          Maximilian - One of the older players on this list. Maximilian has been absent from this game for quite some time and has fallen in rank because of hit. Despite being inactive, he is still very influential and is a milestone for those who attempt to pass him. His time in the game was spent with the mindset of having fun, much before the culture of osu! shifted towards a "play to be the best" mentality. Contrary to this, he is still able to utilize skills from his era in modern times in the event he ever decides to return.

          Placeholder Text - Competition is not in this player's dictionary. Although they have played is several tournaments, their main focus in the game is playing the maps they enjoy most and having a pleasant time with friends. His mindset has allowed him to perform well at what he enjoys doing most, making it possible to play many maps with ease. Additionally, he has shown a disporportionate amount of skill for his level when pushed to his limits.

          Sabibibi - A human metronome with unmatched accuracy for his level. Sabibibi's skill in the game comes down to playing the same maps numerous times in order to get the perfect score on them. With hundreds of tries invested on several maps, it shows how fearsome and determined he is when playing the game. If given time, he can become a truly remarkable player, and his progression thus far shows that.

          TheDustOfTimes - The highest ranked player out of the bunch. Coming in at about 10,000 globally, or in the top 0.00065% of all registered users. Through sheer determination and willpower, this player has found rivals along the way and has used competition to fuel their drive to play game at levels they initally thought were impossible. In recent times, their skills are no longer as sharp as they used to be in the main fundamental aspects of the game, such as speed or aim. But he continues to play despite for the sake of having a good time and refining less popular skills such as oldschool reading patterns and complex rhythm.

          TwoSalty4U - The newest player on this list. TwoSalty4U is the only player on this list to use a mouse to play the game, as a tablet is usually more common. He has shown that it is not necessary to purchase a tablet in order to play the game at any level. Accuracy is second in his agenda, as he plays the game with an absurd amount of aim for his level. His display of skill comes mostly from other games where he also uses a mouse, making it easy for him to transition into osu!.
